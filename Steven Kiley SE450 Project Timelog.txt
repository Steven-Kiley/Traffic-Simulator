Steven Kiley Final Project Time Sheet


10/21/14 From 5:11 PM until 8:39 PM - 
Premilinary planning for base classes, time spent going through code for Demo, Agent, Timeserver, World.
Figuring out what the scope of the project is and developing thoughts on how to achieve results.
Design:               ~2.5 hours
Coding/Debugging:     ~0.75 hours
Big Bugs:             ~0 hours

10/22/14 From 5:50 PM until 8:06 PM - 
Felt way around code examples some more, dveloped road + car interfaces and implementing classes. Started
adapting TimeServer and World interfaces/classes to project needs.
Design:               ~1 hour
Coding/Debugging:     ~1.25 hours
Big Bugs:             ~0 hours

10/23/14 From 4:33 PM until 9:23 PM - 
Wrote code implementing more of TimeServer, World, Road, and Car. Spent time getting them to fit together. Changed 
design for RoadInterface to be Implemented by a new class for each movement direction, and that class to create its 
subsequent, directionally moving cars. This allows future expansion for two lane road even though that is outside of
the project scope.
Design:               ~1 hour
Coding/Debugging:     ~4 hours
Big Bugs:             ~0 hours

10/24/14 From 6:11 PM until 9:43 PM - 
COntinued rebuild of Road/Car objects. Unforseen changes needed to be made to WorldObj in order to produce desired results.
Ran into bug at end of night, couldn't nail it down.
Design:               ~0 hours
Coding Debugging:     ~2.25 hours
Big Bugs:             ~1.25 hours
      -NullPointerException while running a temporary/test main function.

10/25/14 From 9:14 AM until 12:17 PM - 
Debugging NullPointerException. Succeded. Successful test run of all created objects interacting. Car drives down road.
Started looking into the Swing code/ how to graphically represent data.
Design:               ~0.75 hours
Coding/Debugging:     ~0.75 hours
Big Bugs:             ~1.5 hours
      -NullPointerException turned out to be from a silly mistake. Wrote a class variable, then created an instance variable of the 
       same name. Literally one word in the code resulting in uninitialized class variable in created instance of class.


10/27/14 From 4:34 PM until 5:31 PM - 
Completing tests, cleaning up code. Reformatted this time sheet to be more readable.
Design:               ~0.5 hours
