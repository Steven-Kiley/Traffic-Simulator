# Traffic-Simulator

The purpose of this project was to create an end to end application using graphic output and a simple (textual) user interface with the 
intention of learning and demonstrating in practice a number of Object Oriented Design Patterns. There are a number design patterns that 
were used in the creating of this application. Please see the "Project Walkthrough" file for a rundown of the design patterns applied.

Java 7 SE was used in creating the application. 

Thanks,
Steven Kiley
